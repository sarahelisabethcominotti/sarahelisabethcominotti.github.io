# WORDLE
The JUMP Digital game project | Wordle is a daily word game that involves figuring out a secret five-letter word. You play by guessing different five-letter words to see how close they are to the secret word. When you submit a guess, the game will tell you how close your guess is by color-coding each letter in your guess.

Our expected outcome:
- To have a grid displayed which can be filled by the letters selected by the user
- To have an alphabetic board that can can be clicked on and persist on the grid
- To have the correct corresponding colours for each selected character

# HOW TO PLAY

- Each guess must be a valid five-letter word.

- The color of a tile will change to show you how close your guess was.

- If the tile turns green, the letter is in the word, and it is in the correct spot.

- If the tile turns yellow, the letter is in the word, but it is not in the correct spot.

- If the tile turns gray, the letter is not in the word.
